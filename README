We have design the program as followed:

program process:
The manager of the program is the Sjavac class, which calls the parser with the given sJava file.
Using the goOver method, The parser runs throughout the file, creates an array of the relevant lines to check,
and initializes a global scope object containing the global variables and methods.
(Needless to say that if a line in the file doesn't match any regex, an exception is thrown).
Then, the program validates each method contained by the globalScope.
Each scope has an isScopeValid method that verifies its' validation. In that way, each time we meet a new
variable declaration / variable assignment / a new scope (if/while), we immediately check its'
specific validation, and so on...
Slightly different from the global scope content check, an Inner scope validation is composed by a signature
check and a content check that are unique to an Inner scope type.

program scope - design:
As mentioned, there are three different types of scopes: global, block and method scope.
Yet, the block and the method scopes are inner scopes, unlike the global. From that reason, the block and
method scopes has a lot in common (data members and methods). That is why we created the InnerScope abstract
class extending the super-class Scope. As a result, the MethodScope and BlockScope classes became short and
exact. Each scope know's its' upper scope and its' global scope. Using that fact, each scope can know the pre-
declared/assigned variable and all the methods declared in the global scope. In addition, it has its'
content (held by an ArrayList<String> object). Thus, the verification is easy, progressive and immune to
OutOfBound exceptions.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================

In this project we implemented the composing principle. For example, a variable object contains a variableType
object rather than just assign it an informative string. Using the variableType object we can compare variables,
method arguments and parameters. Another example is that each scope has a data member of its' global scope.
Thus,whenever we meet a method call command we can easily ask the global scope whether it's contained by it or not.

Moreover, concerning exceptions, we used nested-classes to emphasize the connection among the different
exception types and of-course for striving for a shorter code and less unnecessary classes files.

=============================

                          ******** Error Handling (section 6.1) *********

We decided to have an abstract class represents an general Sjava exception clas, from which a specific
exceptions classes that can be occur while parsing the s-java file inherit.
the specific exception class are: MethodException (represents an exception related to methods. For example
when calling a method that does not exist), VariableException (represents an exception related to variable.
For example when trying to assign new value to a final variable or when tyring yo assign value to a variable
that have not been initialized) and SyntaxException (represent a syntax exception in s-java file).
Errors that occur due to IO problems have already been treated in the program's main class (Sjavac).

                        ******** Object Oriented Design (section 6.2) ********

Dilling with classes:
if we had to dill with classes written in the Sjava file we would add another class extending scope class.
It is important to notice that a ClassScope is similar to an InnerScope and a GlobalScope bur yet differ from.
In that case, the isScopeValid method of the globalScope will ask if all ClassScopes are valid that will ask
if all the methodScopes are valid that will ask if all the blockScopes are valid and so on...
the globalScope will contain an array of all the classes that will contain an array of all methods and so on.

Dilling with standard Java methods:
In that case we will add some compatible regex and matchers and as we go through the file we will ask if the
current line matches its' regex, if so, a corresponding action will be executed.

                        ******** Regular Expressions (section 6.2) ********

\s*(final\s+)?(String|int|double|boolean|char)\s+((?:_\w+|[a-zA-Z]+\w*\s*(?:=\s*(".*"|-?\d*\.?\d+|'.'
|true|false|-?\d*\.?\d+|-?\d+|_\w+|[a-zA-Z]+\w*))?\s*,\s*)*(?:_\w+|[a-zA-Z]+\w*\s*(?:=\s*(".*"|-?\d*\.?\d+|'.'
|true|false|-?\d*\.?\d+|-?\d+|_\w+|[a-zA-Z]+\w*))?\s*))\s*;\s**

This regular expression is used to catch a variable declaration in sJava file.
It has 3 groups, the first is the the final declaration, the second is the variableType declared and the third is
the variables themselves with their assignments.

\s*(?:if|while)\s*\((.*)\)\s*\{\s*

This regular expression is used to catch a block (if/while) signature in sJava file.
The only group is the blocks' inner statement (the value inside the brackets). Later on, the program verifies
the statement is indeed valid.
